# Ledge

A personal budgeting app for iOS that connects to bank, credit card, and investment accounts via Plaid. Users categorize transactions, set budgets, and track reimbursements — built for a small, closed group of friends rather than the general public.

Each user connects Plaid with their **own** Plaid developer credentials (BYOK — bring your own key), entered in-app after signup. This keeps everyone's linked-account usage isolated under their own free Plaid account instead of sharing one app-wide key.

Raw financial data (transactions, balances, account numbers) **never persists on the backend** — it's fetched live from Plaid on each request and relayed straight to the device. Only user-defined metadata (categories, budgets, vendor mappings, reimbursement links) is stored server-side.

See `docs/product.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/design.md` for the full spec.

| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Mobile          | React Native (Expo Router) + NativeWind |
| Backend         | Node.js + Fastify + tRPC + Drizzle ORM  |
| Database / Auth | Supabase (Postgres + Auth)              |
| Financial data  | Plaid API (BYOK, server-side only)      |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (Postgres + Auth), with the **Google** auth provider enabled and the **Email** provider disabled
- A [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com) project with an OAuth consent screen and two OAuth clients (one **Web**, registered on Supabase's Google provider; one **iOS**, for bundle ID `com.qihongw08.ledge`)
- Xcode + an Apple Developer account, for running the iOS app on a simulator or device
- Your own free [Plaid](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup) developer account (added per-user, in-app — not a project-level secret)

## Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env   # fill in the values below
npm install
npm run db:migrate     # applies the Drizzle schema to your Supabase Postgres
npm run dev            # starts the Fastify server on :3000
```

## Frontend

| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` | Google Cloud → Credentials → your **Web** OAuth client ID (the same one registered on Supabase's Google provider)                                                             |

### Notes on native builds

- **Google Sign-In is a native module** (`@react-native-google-signin/google-signin`). Its config plugin writes a URL scheme into the Info.plist, so replace `REPLACE_WITH_REVERSED_IOS_CLIENT_ID` in `app.json` with your iOS client ID's reversed form (Google Cloud lists it as the "iOS URL scheme"), then run `npx expo prebuild --clean && npm run ios` — it will not take effect on an existing build.
- **Plaid Link is a native module** (`react-native-plaid-link-sdk`) and does not run in Expo Go — `npm run ios`/`npm run android` build a real dev client via `expo prebuild`, which needs Xcode/CocoaPods installed.
- **Plaid OAuth institutions** (Chase, Bank of America, etc.) require a universal link, which needs: a paid Apple Developer Program membership, the **Associated Domains** capability with an explicit (non-wildcard) App ID registered on the Apple Developer portal, an `apple-app-site-association` file hosted at your redirect domain, that same URL registered in the Plaid Dashboard's Allowed redirect URIs, and `PLAID_REDIRECT_URI` set on the backend. Non-OAuth Sandbox institutions (e.g. "Platypus Bank", `user_good`/`pass_good`) work without any of this.
- **Real/live institutions require Plaid Production keys**, entered by each user in Settings → Plaid Developer Account with Environment set to Production. Sandbox keys only work against Plaid's fake test institutions — linking a real bank always needs the user's own Production `client_id`/`secret` from their Plaid dashboard.
