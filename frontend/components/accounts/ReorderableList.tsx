 *
 * The gesture has to coexist with two others already on these rows: a tap that opens the
 * account sheet, and the page's vertical scroll. Long-press arming is what separates all
 * three. A press that never reaches LIFT_DELAY_MS is a tap; a drag that starts before the
 * row lifts belongs to the ScrollView; only once armed does this claim the gesture. The
 * claim uses the CAPTURE phase because the row's own Pressable is already the responder by
 * then, and capture is the only way a parent takes a gesture back from its child.
 *
 * Deliberately no auto-scroll at the list edges. Account groups run 2-5 rows and collapse,
 * so a lifted row can always reach its target without the page moving — which removes the
 * fiddliest part of drag-to-reorder for a case that cannot arise here.
